The energy cost of 1 h human labor is generally estimated according to its physiological requirement (the hierarchical level at which the assessment is made is at the individual level). A different way of describing the interaction between human society and the ecosystem is presented in this paper (assessment referred to the society level). The shift from the individual level to the societal level provides a new perspective when assessing the energetic efficiency of farming. For example, the power level of the system becomes a new and important parameter to consider. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.},

The book combines a vast historical sweep with cross-cultural comparisons and is enhanced by illustrations and accessible quantitative material. Students and general readers alike will gain an understanding of energy's fundamental role in human progress.Smil illuminates the role played by various means of harnessing energy in different societies and provides new insights by explaining the impact and limitations of these fundamental physical inputs--whether it is in the cultivation of crops, smelting of metals, waging of war, or the mass production of goods. While examining the energetic foundations of historical changes, "Energy in World History" avoids simplistic, deterministic views of energy needs and recognizes the complex interplay of physical and social realities.},

However, an overactive immune response can cause tissue damage and sepsis. The endogenous molecule hemoglobin and its derivative heme are often released into tissue compartments where there is infection in the presence of degrading blood. We found that hemoglobin synergizes with multiple TLR agonists to induce high levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 from macrophages and that this synergy is independent of TLR4 and MyD88. In contrast, heme synergized with some but not all TLR agonists studied. Furthermore, the synergy of both hemoglobin and heme with lipopolysaccharide was suppressed by hemopexin, a plasma heme-binding protein. These studies suggest that hemoglobin and heme may substantially contribute to microbe-induced inflammation when bacterial or viral infection coexists with blood degradation and that hemopexin may play a role in controlling inflammation in such settings.},

This study mainly compares the exergy output of the two kinds of solar cogeneration systems under different temperatures of the return heating water and different inlet temperatures of the solar collectors. This study shows that, from the perspective of    W   n e t    or      E   ̲     n    , the parallel mode is superior to the series mode. From the perspective of    E   z    , the parallel mode is superior to the series mode when the solar collector is FPC; however, the series mode is superior to the parallel mode when the solar collector is PTC. When the solar collector is ETC, the result depends on the temperature of the return heating water. When the temperature of the return heating water is low (below 46°C), the series mode is better, and when the temperature of the return heating water is high (above 46°C), the parallel mode is better. },

abstract = {Urbanisation in China and its rapid increase in recent decades as a result of industrialisation and globalisation are often conceived as a simplified process. Moreover, the speed of the present day process yields the impression that the traces of previous forms of urbanisation are erased for good. Both of these assumptions are challenged in this paper. The built environment resulting from this urbanisation process is to be conceived as a series of layers that reflect different modes of productions and related logics of production of space. Hence, we try to comprehend the spatial arrangement of the city, which can be thought of as a geological metaphor. The social groups that have to be sheltered in urban residential space also radically change in each of these periods. We proceed to analyse these layers and how they combine and interact over time with the concept of socio-spatial configuration, which denotes a precise type of residential environment related to a specific social group in the city. Chinese cities are made up of five types of urbanisation, reflected in five layers and their related socio-spatial configurations: the traditional, proto-globalisation, socialist, market-led and globalisation layers.},

An ongoing transition in the United States is driven by environmental concerns, changing patterns of energy end-use, constraints on petroleum supply. Analysis of prior transitions shows that energy intensity in the U.S. from 1820 to 2010 features a declining trend when traditional energy is included, in contrast to the "inverted U-curve" seen when only commercial energy is considered. This analysis quantifies use of human and animal muscle power, wind and water power, biomass, harvested ice, fossil fuels, and nuclear power, with some consumption series extending back to 1780. The analysis reaffirms the importance of innovation in energy conversion technologies in energy transitions. An increase in energy intensity in the early 20th century is explained by diminishing returns to pre-electric manufacturing systems, which produced a transformation in manufacturing. In comparison to similar studies for other countries, the U.S. has generally higher energy intensity.},

This has implied that there is a lack of coherent evaluations of efficiency and diet as options for keeping down the long-term production requirements for crops and other food phytomass. This paper presents estimates of current efficiency and phytomass appropriation of major food commodities, performed by modeling all principal flows of biomass in the food system. Estimated overall efficiencies varied from 0.35{\%} for beef cattle meat, to 31{\%} for starchy root tubers (global averages, gross energy basis). The results indicate that there is a most substantial potential for efficiency improvements within the animal food sector, particularly for ruminant systems in non-industrialized regions. It is also concluded that a considerable reduction of the phytomass production might be achieved by shifts in diet, even if assuming no changes with respect to the total share of meat in the diet. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {51 Conventional economic growth theory assumes that technological progress is exogenous and that resource 52 consumption is a consequence, not a cause, of growth. The reality is different and more complex. A ‘growth 53 engine' is a positive feedback loop involving declining costs of inputs and increasing demand for lower 5 6 54 priced outputs, which then drives costs down further, thanks to economies of scale and learning effects. 55 In a competitive environment prices follow. The most important ‘growth engine' of the first industrial 56 revolution was dependent on coal and steam power. The feedback operated through rapidly declining fossil 57 fuel and mechanical power costs. The advent of electric power, in growing quantities and declining cost, 58 has triggered the development of a whole range of new products and industries, including electric light, 59 radio and television, moving pictures, and the whole modern information sector. The purpose of this paper 60 is to reformulate the idea of the ‘growth engine' in terms of the service provided by energy inputs, namely 61 ‘useful work', defined as the product of energy (exergy) inputs multiplied by a conversion efficiency. We 62 attempt here to reconstruct the useful work performed in the US economy during the twentieth century. 63 Some economic implications are indicated very briefl},

In trials where steady state conditions had become established the mean operating power of a pair of oxen ranged from approximately 210 W for relatively light work with a country plough to 1010 W for a wheeled toolcarrier. Trials with a loading car increased the range of operating conditions and facilitated the examination of ox-implement interactions. Mean heart rates and stepping rates were found to be well correlated with mean power and mean speed respectively. Evidence was found that the nature of the draught force, whether erratic or smooth, in addition to its magnitude, influenced physiological stress.

This thesis addresses the issue of the satisfaction of energy end-uses, considering its quantity and quality. This is accomplished advancing the understanding of the role of useful work changes across technological, societal and economic transitions. In this thesis, a systematic methodology for useful work accounting at country-level is presented and employed to analyze the main transitions from pre- to post-industrial eras in two European countries: Portugal from 1856 to 2009 and the United Kingdom from 1700 to 2009. Useful work is also obtained for the European Union member-states (prior to the 2004-enlargment) from 1960 to 2009. These analyses provide some stylized facts of the useful work and thermodynamic efficiencies‖ transitions in Western European countries over the last decades / centuries. Useful work allows for an interpretation of societal and economic transitions, related with changes in the way energy is used and which services energy provides over time, that would not be possible with an analysis exclusively based on conventional energy accounting methods.

An agrarian society has given way to an industrial society and lately to a post-industrial phase. The energy supply systems have changed, from traditional energy carriers, such as firewood and muscle energy to modern carriers like coal, oil and electricity, with effects on CO 2 emissions. Not only the energy supply has gone through fundamental changes, but also forest management, which affects the net emissions of CO 2. The interrelations of growth, energy and CO 2 are analyzed in this thesis, which uses standard calculations, relative price analyses and energy quality factors, to determine the relative effects of structural and technical changes, including changes in energy carrier composition to explain the long term delinking of energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and economic growth that takes place.},

abstract = {The domestication and historical development of the donkey are traced through archaeological and linguistic associations. The donkey is indigenous to the African continent and its wild progenitor is usually considered to be the Nubian wild ass. Historically, a chain of races of wild ass spread from the Atlas Mountains to the Red Sea and probably as far south as the border of present-day northern Kenya. The wild ass may well have been domesticated several times, given the semi-feral production systems under which it was managed until recently. Records of domestic asses begin in Egypt in the fourth millennium BC. The extent to which the wild ass penetrated the interior of Africa is unknown. Faunal remains and rock art representations are extremely rare, which is somewhat at odds with the widespread distribution and economic importance of the donkey in Africa today. This apparent contradiction can probably be explained by the fact that donkeys have been of most importance to poor households and have consequently had low prestige. The spread of the donkey across Africa was linked with the proliferation of long distance caravans. It is argued that greater attention to the nearly extinct wild ass and to traditional management systems could be helpful in the future development of the donkey in Africa},

However, their methodological approaches vary greatly, with significant impacts on results. Therefore, we make a review of past studies to identify, synthesize and discuss methodological differences, to contribute to a more consistent and robust approach to societal exergy accounting. Issues that should be taken into account when making methodological options are discussed and key insights are presented: (1) For mapping of primary inputs and useful exergy categories, the inclusion of all natural resources is more consistent but it has the cost of not being able to distinguish the various energy end-uses in the production of materials. (2) To estimate primary electricity, none of the methods currently used is able to capture simultaneously the efficiency of the renewable energy sector, the environmental impact and the efficiency of energy use in society. (3) To estimate final-to-useful exergy conversion efficiencies, standard thermodynamic definitions should be used because the use of proxies fails to distinguish between increases in exergy efficiency and increases in the efficiency of providing energy services.},

These animals are used for agriculture operations in 52{\%} of cultivated areas of the world, as well as for hauling 25 million carts. This situation is likely to continue for at least another fifty years.

The poor working conditions of these animals often adversely affect their productivity. The application of improved technology and better management (i.e. through better feed and health services, and improved design of agricultural implements and carts) could considerably improve the welfare of these animals. Improved systems would generate sufficient benefits for the economy to justify the required investment.

abstract = {The 'human appropriation of net primary production' (HANPP) is an integrated socio-ecological indicator measuring effects of land use on ecological biomass flows. Based on published data for Austria, Hungary, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain and the UK, this paper investigates long-term trends in aboveground HANPP and discusses the relations between population, economic growth, changes in biomass use and land-use intensity and their influences on national HANPP trajectories. During early stages of industrialization, population growth and increasing demand for biomass drive land-cover change, often resulting in deforestation, which raises HANPP. During later stages, industrialization of agriculture boosts agricultural yields often faster than biomass demand grows, resulting in stable or even declining HANPP. Technological change improves agricultural area-efficiency (biomass provision per unit area), thereby decoupling population and economic growth from HANPP. However, these efficiency gains require large inputs of fossil fuels and agrochemicals resulting in pressures on ecosystems and emissions. Our findings corroborate the argument that HANPP alone cannot - as sometimes suggested - be used as a simple measure of carrying capacity. Nevertheless, analyses of long-term HANPP trajectories in combination with accounts of material and energy flows can provide important insights into the sustainability of land use, thereby helping to understand limits to growth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {There are very few useful work and exergy analysis studies for China, and fewer still that consider how the results inform drivers of past and future energy consumption. This is surprising: China is the world's largest energy consumer, whilst exergy analysis provides a robust thermodynamic framework for analysing the technical efficiency of energy use. In response, we develop three novel sub-analyses. First we perform a long-term whole economy time-series exergy analysis for China (1971-2010). We find a 10-fold growth in China's useful work since 1971, which is supplied by a 4-fold increase in primary energy coupled to a 2.5-fold gain in aggregate exergy conversion efficiency to useful work: from 5{\%} to 12.5{\%}. Second, using index decomposition we expose the key driver of efficiency growth as not 'technological leapfrogging' but structural change: i.e. increasing reliance on thermodynamically efficient (but very energy intensive) heavy industrial activities. Third, we extend our useful work analysis to estimate China's future primary energy demand, and find values for 2030 that are significantly above mainstream projections.},

abstract = {National exergy efficiency analysis relates the quality of primary energy inputs to an economy with end useful work in sectoral energy uses such as transport, heat and electrical devices. This approach has been used by a range of authors to explore insights to macroscale energy systems and linkages with economic growth. However, these analyses use a variety of calculation methods with sometimes coarse assumptions, inhibiting comparisons. Therefore, building on previous studies, this paper first contributes toward a common useful work accounting framework, by developing more refined methodological techniques for electricity end use and transport exergy efficiencies. Second, to test this more consistent and granular approach, these advances are applied to the US and UK for 1960 to 2010. The results reveal divergent aggregate exergy efficiencies: US efficiency remains stable at around 11{\%}, while UK efficiency rises from 9{\%} to 15{\%}. The US efficiency stagnation is due to "efficiency dilution", where structural shifts to lower efficiency consumption (e.g., air-conditioning) outweigh device-level efficiency gains. The results demonstrate this is an important area of research, with consequent implications for national energy efficiency policies.},

abstract = {This paper provides information on the number of draught animals of various kinds that were used in agriculture in Europe during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the sources and assumptions we have used in making our estimates. Tables provide animal numbers in thousands for each country at benchmark dates. The aim of the paper is to provide a methodological approach to assessing the availability of draught power over time, and an explanation of how the available statistical information from various European countries can be employed to this end. This paper will be linked to a more detailed analysis of the role of draught power in raising agricultural output and factor productivity in European agriculture in the period 1800-1914. However, our main concern has not been to estimate draught power (although it would indeed be desirable to know this figure), but the energy consumption of draught livestock. In other words, we are interested at this stage in energy inputs into the animals, not the final consumption of energy used for useful work, or indeed the power output of the animals when working. The energy consumption of the animals is energy contained in the fodder that they consume. This is in turn a function of the animal's size, the length of time spent working, and the intensity of their work. The last two figures could only be very roughly estimated on the aggregate level of the agricultural sector across nations, and we have not attempted to do this. We have however built a simple model of likely energy consumption levels based on estimates of the average size of animals at benchmark dates. This is the subject of the second part of the paper. The paper proceeds on a country-by-country basis. While the principles underlying the calculations made for each country are generally the same, the procedures followed by contemporary statisticians who assembled the data varied, as will be seen. This has required methods of estimation tailored to suit each individual country.},

abstract = {Photo: Roland Thunholm This report aims to provide an overall picture of the horse industry in Europe and its economic importance. The purpose is to describe different characteristics of the horse industry in the European countries and to illustrate both similarities and differences. The report consists of four sections discussing the economic role of the horse, the impacts of the CAP (EU Common Agricultural Policy) on the horse industry, the breeding industry as well as the role of the horse in the civil society. The information used for this report is based upon official statistics from Eurostat, FAOStat, UET, IFHA and FEI. Moreover, as statistics of the horse sector is sometimes limited, questionnaires concerning the horse industry as a whole, the trotting as well as the thoroughbred racing industry have been sent to representatives of the countries in the European Union. The representatives were selected from the register of COPA-delegates, from the respective ministries of agriculture or from the local UET and IFHA organizations. It should however be noted that the results in this study are based on individual responses to questionnaires sometimes based on own approximations made by individuals involved in the industry. Hence, the information provided here should to some extent be regarded more as an indication of how the status of the sector has changed and provide a general view of development trends. A general conclusion from this report is that statistics regarding the horse industry within the European countries is rather limited and much has to be done in this respect in order to provide an accurate picture of the industry. Hereby it should be stressed that future research into equine sciences also should include studies on information systems and international harmonization of data.},
