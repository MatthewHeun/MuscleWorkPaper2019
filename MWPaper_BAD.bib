	Abstract = {During the colonial period in West Africa, European officials and businessmen faced a perennial shortage of labor; their response was to rely on coercion. Despite their rhetoric of ``free wage labor,'' colonial officials thought Africans needed encouragement to understand time and work discipline. Africans continually resisted, making forced labor inefficient and costly. West Africans incorporated the European rhetoric of the abolition of slavery, free wage labor and workers' benefits into their protests against colonial labor practices. By the late 1940s, most forms of forced labor had been abolished.},

	Abstract = {51 Conventional economic growth theory assumes that technological progress is exogenous and that resource 52 consumption is a consequence, not a cause, of growth. The reality is different and more complex. A `growth 53 engine' is a positive feedback loop involving declining costs of inputs and increasing demand for lower 5 6 54 priced outputs, which then drives costs down further, thanks to economies of scale and learning effects. 55 In a competitive environment prices follow. The most important `growth engine' of the first industrial 56 revolution was dependent on coal and steam power. The feedback operated through rapidly declining fossil 57 fuel and mechanical power costs. The advent of electric power, in growing quantities and declining cost, 58 has triggered the development of a whole range of new products and industries, including electric light, 59 radio and television, moving pictures, and the whole modern information sector. The purpose of this paper 60 is to reformulate the idea of the `growth engine' in terms of the service provided by energy inputs, namely 61 `useful work', defined as the product of energy (exergy) inputs multiplied by a conversion efficiency. We 62 attempt here to reconstruct the useful work performed in the US economy during the twentieth century. 63 Some economic implications are indicated very briefl},

@article{Blench1997,
	Abstract = {The domestication and historical development of the donkey are traced through archaeological and linguistic associations. The donkey is indigenous to the African continent and its wild progenitor is usually considered to be the Nubian wild ass. Historically, a chain of races of wild ass spread from the Atlas Mountains to the Red Sea and probably as far south as the border of present-day northern Kenya. The wild ass may well have been domesticated several times, given the semi-feral production systems under which it was managed until recently. Records of domestic asses begin in Egypt in the fourth millennium BC. The extent to which the wild ass penetrated the interior of Africa is unknown. Faunal remains and rock art representations are extremely rare, which is somewhat at odds with the widespread distribution and economic importance of the donkey in Africa today. This apparent contradiction can probably be explained by the fact that donkeys have been of most importance to poor households and have consequently had low prestige. The spread of the donkey across Africa was linked with the proliferation of long distance caravans. It is argued that greater attention to the nearly extinct wild ass and to traditional management systems could be helpful in the future development of the donkey in Africa},

@article{Brockway2014,
	Abstract = {National exergy efficiency analysis relates the quality of primary energy inputs to an economy with end useful work in sectoral energy uses such as transport, heat and electrical devices. This approach has been used by a range of authors to explore insights to macroscale energy systems and linkages with economic growth. However, these analyses use a variety of calculation methods with sometimes coarse assumptions, inhibiting comparisons. Therefore, building on previous studies, this paper first contributes toward a common useful work accounting framework, by developing more refined methodological techniques for electricity end use and transport exergy efficiencies. Second, to test this more consistent and granular approach, these advances are applied to the US and UK for 1960 to 2010. The results reveal divergent aggregate exergy efficiencies: US efficiency remains stable at around 11{\%}, while UK efficiency rises from 9{\%} to 15{\%}. The US efficiency stagnation is due to "efficiency dilution", where structural shifts to lower efficiency consumption (e.g., air-conditioning) outweigh device-level efficiency gains. The results demonstrate this is an important area of research, with consequent implications for national energy efficiency policies.},

@article{Brockway2015,
	Abstract = {There are very few useful work and exergy analysis studies for China, and fewer still that consider how the results inform drivers of past and future energy consumption. This is surprising: China is the world's largest energy consumer, whilst exergy analysis provides a robust thermodynamic framework for analysing the technical efficiency of energy use. In response, we develop three novel sub-analyses. First we perform a long-term whole economy time-series exergy analysis for China (1971-2010). We find a 10-fold growth in China's useful work since 1971, which is supplied by a 4-fold increase in primary energy coupled to a 2.5-fold gain in aggregate exergy conversion efficiency to useful work: from 5{\%} to 12.5{\%}. Second, using index decomposition we expose the key driver of efficiency growth as not 'technological leapfrogging' but structural change: i.e. increasing reliance on thermodynamically efficient (but very energy intensive) heavy industrial activities. Third, we extend our useful work analysis to estimate China's future primary energy demand, and find values for 2030 that are significantly above mainstream projections.},

	Abstract = {Detection of microbial components by immune cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) with subsequent induction of inflammation is essential for host defense. However, an overactive immune response can cause tissue damage and sepsis. The endogenous molecule hemoglobin and its derivative heme are often released into tissue compartments where there is infection in the presence of degrading blood. We found that hemoglobin synergizes with multiple TLR agonists to induce high levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 from macrophages and that this synergy is independent of TLR4 and MyD88. In contrast, heme synergized with some but not all TLR agonists studied. Furthermore, the synergy of both hemoglobin and heme with lipopolysaccharide was suppressed by hemopexin, a plasma heme-binding protein. These studies suggest that hemoglobin and heme may substantially contribute to microbe-induced inflammation when bacterial or viral infection coexists with blood degradation and that hemopexin may play a role in controlling inflammation in such settings.},

	Abstract = {Urbanisation in China and its rapid increase in recent decades as a result of industrialisation and globalisation are often conceived as a simplified process. Moreover, the speed of the present day process yields the impression that the traces of previous forms of urbanisation are erased for good. Both of these assumptions are challenged in this paper. The built environment resulting from this urbanisation process is to be conceived as a series of layers that reflect different modes of productions and related logics of production of space. Hence, we try to comprehend the spatial arrangement of the city, which can be thought of as a geological metaphor. The social groups that have to be sheltered in urban residential space also radically change in each of these periods. We proceed to analyse these layers and how they combine and interact over time with the concept of socio-spatial configuration, which denotes a precise type of residential environment related to a specific social group in the city. Chinese cities are made up of five types of urbanisation, reflected in five layers and their related socio-spatial configurations: the traditional, proto-globalisation, socialist, market-led and globalisation layers.},

	Abstract = {Large transformations of technologies have occurred in the Swedish economy during the last two centuries, resulting in higher income, better quality of products and changing composition of GDP. An agrarian society has given way to an industrial society and lately to a post-industrial phase. The energy supply systems have changed, from traditional energy carriers, such as firewood and muscle energy to modern carriers like coal, oil and electricity, with effects on CO 2 emissions. Not only the energy supply has gone through fundamental changes, but also forest management, which affects the net emissions of CO 2. The interrelations of growth, energy and CO 2 are analyzed in this thesis, which uses standard calculations, relative price analyses and energy quality factors, to determine the relative effects of structural and technical changes, including changes in energy carrier composition to explain the long term delinking of energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and economic growth that takes place.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides information on the number of draught animals of various kinds that were used in agriculture in Europe during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the sources and assumptions we have used in making our estimates. Tables provide animal numbers in thousands for each country at benchmark dates. The aim of the paper is to provide a methodological approach to assessing the availability of draught power over time, and an explanation of how the available statistical information from various European countries can be employed to this end. This paper will be linked to a more detailed analysis of the role of draught power in raising agricultural output and factor productivity in European agriculture in the period 1800-1914. However, our main concern has not been to estimate draught power (although it would indeed be desirable to know this figure), but the energy consumption of draught livestock. In other words, we are interested at this stage in energy inputs into the animals, not the final consumption of energy used for useful work, or indeed the power output of the animals when working. The energy consumption of the animals is energy contained in the fodder that they consume. This is in turn a function of the animal's size, the length of time spent working, and the intensity of their work. The last two figures could only be very roughly estimated on the aggregate level of the agricultural sector across nations, and we have not attempted to do this. We have however built a simple model of likely energy consumption levels based on estimates of the average size of animals at benchmark dates. This is the subject of the second part of the paper. The paper proceeds on a country-by-country basis. While the principles underlying the calculations made for each country are generally the same, the procedures followed by contemporary statisticians who assembled the data varied, as will be seen. This has required methods of estimation tailored to suit each individual country.},

	Abstract = {The 'human appropriation of net primary production' (HANPP) is an integrated socio-ecological indicator measuring effects of land use on ecological biomass flows. Based on published data for Austria, Hungary, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain and the UK, this paper investigates long-term trends in aboveground HANPP and discusses the relations between population, economic growth, changes in biomass use and land-use intensity and their influences on national HANPP trajectories. During early stages of industrialization, population growth and increasing demand for biomass drive land-cover change, often resulting in deforestation, which raises HANPP. During later stages, industrialization of agriculture boosts agricultural yields often faster than biomass demand grows, resulting in stable or even declining HANPP. Technological change improves agricultural area-efficiency (biomass provision per unit area), thereby decoupling population and economic growth from HANPP. However, these efficiency gains require large inputs of fossil fuels and agrochemicals resulting in pressures on ecosystems and emissions. Our findings corroborate the argument that HANPP alone cannot - as sometimes suggested - be used as a simple measure of carrying capacity. Nevertheless, analyses of long-term HANPP trajectories in combination with accounts of material and energy flows can provide important insights into the sustainability of land use, thereby helping to understand limits to growth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	Abstract = {Photo: Roland Thunholm This report aims to provide an overall picture of the horse industry in Europe and its economic importance. The purpose is to describe different characteristics of the horse industry in the European countries and to illustrate both similarities and differences. The report consists of four sections discussing the economic role of the horse, the impacts of the CAP (EU Common Agricultural Policy) on the horse industry, the breeding industry as well as the role of the horse in the civil society. The information used for this report is based upon official statistics from Eurostat, FAOStat, UET, IFHA and FEI. Moreover, as statistics of the horse sector is sometimes limited, questionnaires concerning the horse industry as a whole, the trotting as well as the thoroughbred racing industry have been sent to representatives of the countries in the European Union. The representatives were selected from the register of COPA-delegates, from the respective ministries of agriculture or from the local UET and IFHA organizations. It should however be noted that the results in this study are based on individual responses to questionnaires sometimes based on own approximations made by individuals involved in the industry. Hence, the information provided here should to some extent be regarded more as an indication of how the status of the sector has changed and provide a general view of development trends. A general conclusion from this report is that statistics regarding the horse industry within the European countries is rather limited and much has to be done in this respect in order to provide an accurate picture of the industry. Hereby it should be stressed that future research into equine sciences also should include studies on information systems and international harmonization of data.},

An ongoing transition in the United States is driven by environmental concerns, changing patterns of energy end-use, constraints on petroleum supply. Analysis of prior transitions shows that energy intensity in the U.S. from 1820 to 2010 features a declining trend when traditional energy is included, in contrast to the "inverted U-curve" seen when only commercial energy is considered. This analysis quantifies use of human and animal muscle power, wind and water power, biomass, harvested ice, fossil fuels, and nuclear power, with some consumption series extending back to 1780. The analysis reaffirms the importance of innovation in energy conversion technologies in energy transitions. An increase in energy intensity in the early 20th century is explained by diminishing returns to pre-electric manufacturing systems, which produced a transformation in manufacturing. In comparison to similar studies for other countries, the U.S. has generally higher energy intensity.},

Therefore, we make a review of past studies to identify, synthesize and discuss methodological differences, to contribute to a more consistent and robust approach to societal exergy accounting. Issues that should be taken into account when making methodological options are discussed and key insights are presented: (1) For mapping of primary inputs and useful exergy categories, the inclusion of all natural resources is more consistent but it has the cost of not being able to distinguish the various energy end-uses in the production of materials. (2) To estimate primary electricity, none of the methods currently used is able to capture simultaneously the efficiency of the renewable energy sector, the environmental impact and the efficiency of energy use in society.

@article{Wirsenius2003,
	Abstract = {In examining the global food supply and demand, the balance of research has favored analysis of the prospects for increased crop production, at the expense of examination of the potential for reducing the production requirements by increases in efficiency and productivity, or by shifts in diets. This has implied that there is a lack of coherent evaluations of efficiency and diet as options for keeping down the long-term production requirements for crops and other food phytomass. This paper presents estimates of current efficiency and phytomass appropriation of major food commodities, performed by modeling all principal flows of biomass in the food system. Estimated overall efficiencies varied from 0.35{\%} for beef cattle meat, to 31{\%} for starchy root tubers (global averages, gross energy basis). The results indicate that there is a most substantial potential for efficiency improvements within the animal food sector, particularly for ruminant systems in non-industrialized regions. It is also concluded that a considerable reduction of the phytomass production might be achieved by shifts in diet, even if assuming no changes with respect to the total share of meat in the diet. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to review the fragmented information on draught animal population dynamics and delivering information for improved production and management plan of a country. A retrospective type of study was used. All research findings, annual report series of agricultural sample survey (1996-2017) and FAOSTAT were reviewed. After checking consistency and large area coverage data from 2005-2017 were used for final growth trend analysis. Simple descriptive statistics and linear models were employed to show the trends. The current study showed that there was a steady growth in camel, horse, and donkey and mule population. The highest growth rates were observed 61.29{\%} in camel, 34.62{\%} in donkey, 24{\%} in mule and 18.4{\%} in horse population. Draught animals are essential to the livelihoods of many households in rural and urban areas of Ethiopia. Therefore attention should be given to these animals.},
